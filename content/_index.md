## Binclub creates software security tools

Binclub is a small team of passionate developers that develops tools to help with software security.

Below are some of our products you may be interested in:

### Binscure
Binscure is an obfuscator for Java applications.

It processes the compiled bytecode from archives like JARs and makes it hard or impossible for reverse engineers to view, understand, or decompile the bytecode.

This protects your application from intellectual property theft or piracy.
